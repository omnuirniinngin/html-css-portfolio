                    <p>In this context diagram gives an overview on how the entire system is built. The researchers identified the external entities which are Project Managers and Members that can be interchangeable since both entities can use all the functionalities. Creating a plan is available for both users since anyone could start a project plan on their own. After creating a plan follows with creating activities that can be also called as task where user can assign task by searching and adding a team member onto a plan. Monitoring and controlling tasks progress can only be done when a team member successfully accepted the pending requested by his project manager. Thus, Monitoring and Controlling can be achieved when assigned member inputs and update a tasks trough adjusting progress bar than can also be view to percentage and other necessary information such as notes. Lastly, after the tasks has been successfully completed the administrator can rate the assigned user’s performance by percentage.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>This Data Flow Diagram illustrates how data is process by the system in terms of inputs and outputs. The Process 1.0 shows the creation of planning and inside this process is a Data Flow Diagram Level 1 that includes input of creating of plan description, tasks, setting schedules and assigning it to members which can be stored in the plan and user’s database.</p>
                    <p>The Process 2.0 is a User Notification module that will notify users on pending requests and updates on progress with their current project involved. The project administrator has the option to send information and notify assigned users through SMS. After accepting pending requests from the project administrator, the assigned member can now view his/her designated tasks. The Process 3.0 lets a member view and update new information about the activities/tasks by inputting necessary notes and adjusting the progress bar that can be send into the data store in plan database.</p>
                    <p>The overall system functionalities are limited for unsubscribed users. Thus, Process 4.0 is a process for starting a subscription that involves data flows about Order Information and Billing Information that can be stored to different database. If the transaction is completed and payment is successfully processed in Process 5.0 then a user can be able to use the said limitations depending on the type of subscription.</p>
